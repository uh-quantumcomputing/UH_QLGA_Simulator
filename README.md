# Quantum Lattice Gas Algorithm Simulator

NOTE: This project is still in a work-in-progress state. 

This software aims to simulate quantum lattice gas algorithms using graphics processing units. 

We have included copies of PhD dissertations from Steven Smith and Jasper Taylor in the References folder. These can be used as references for both the modeling methodology and inplementation. 

## Prerequisites
Hardware:  
* [CUDA capable GPU](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) <br/>

Main software:  <br/>

* [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) <br/>

Python Packages: <br/>

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
* [PyCUDA](https://documen.tician.de/pycuda/)
* [Mayavi](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/)
* [moviePy](https://pypi.org/project/moviepy/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Python-tk](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter)
* [PyQT](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt)

## Getting started

After downloading all the packages, look in the base directory you will find two files "Master.py" and "SimulationMaster.py". These are the main files that will need to be used to run simulations. "SimulationMaster.py" offers more flexibility, such as setting use of specific GPUs or setting up loops to run multiple simulations in succession. "Master.py" is an early version of a simple GUI, to facilitate use by inexperienced coders. Be aware that you may have to use "SimulationMaster.py" first, to generate .pyc files, before using "Master.py" GUI. 

## Built-in Models

Here is a list of some of the built-in models included in the current version of the software. The code is modular, so that a user can also add their own models.

Make sure that the particle number indicator (1P,2P) at the end of the model name matches the number of particles you are simulating. Options described using the format: 
<br/> *Function*(Keyword options) <br/> 

Model and intial condition keywords can both be input into the "Experiment Keywords" field using python dictionary syntax, i.e. {'key':value}. Function based methods, such as *Function_1P* take lists created by the user (see Additional info). Some methods may works across different models, but no guarentee.

## Additional info

External potentials and measurements are also utilized when running "SimulationMaster.py". To do this you change the "POTENTIAL" & "MEASUREMENT" parameters to match the name of the file of the desired method located in "/Code/Initializations/CUDA_physics_models/". Then change the kwargs to desired values, found in the method file.
